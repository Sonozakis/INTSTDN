        <h1>STORY</h1>
        <div class="story">
            <p> Set in the year 11945 AD, the story revolves around a war between the human-made androids and the
                machine army of invaders from another world. Lacking both emotions and true names, androids have
                particular attitudes that distinguish them from their fellow androids. The YoRHa android forces are
                commanded from the Bunker, a reconnaissance base in orbit above Earth. They fight alongside the
                pre-YoRHa
                androids on Earth (known as the Resistance) to drive back the Machines.

                The initial protagonist is 2B (short for "YoRHa No. 2 Type B"), a YoRHa combat android whose main traits
                are
                her calm and composure. 2B is accompanied by 9S (short for YoRHa No.9 Type S), a male "scanner"
                android who displays more emotion than the other YoRHa units. Eventually another playable character is
                introduced: "A2", an obsolete attack android with a taciturn personality who often chooses to act alone.
                The androids are supported by Pod 042 and Pod 153, floating box-like robots that act as ranged
                weapons. The primary antagonist of the game is the machine network and its creations. </p>

            <p>The first and second playthroughs follow the respective views of 2B and 9S during an initial invasion.
                After
                opening a route for future missions, they are sent to clear out machine threats for the Resistance, led
                by
                Anemone, who provides the two with support. During their missions, 2B and 9S discover that the machines
                are
                exploring human societies and concepts. The two work with a pacifist machine group led by Pascal; battle
                Adam and Eve, physical manifestations of the machine network who reveal that their creators were
                destroyed
                centuries ago; and encounter A2, a rogue android on the run from YoRHa. Adam is killed by 2B after he
                captures 9S. During his recuperation, 9S discovers a glitch in YoRHa's servers when syncing himself and
                2B,
                and learns that humanity was extinct long before the alien invasion. Their last remnant is a Moon-based
                server holding humanity's incomplete genome remains. YoRHa perpetuates the myth of their survival to
                maintain morale and give androids a "god" to fight for. With Adam dead, Eve goes mad with grief and
                drives the machines under his command into a frenzy. 2B and 9S kill Eve to end the rampage, but 9S
                becomes
                infected with Eve's logic virus, forcing 2B to kill him. However, 9S's consciousness survives within the
                local machine network. Thus, the two are reunited once again and the story continues. </p>

            <p>After finishing the first and second playthroughs, another playthrough unlocks with an additional three
                endings that uncover the truth behind the world in NieR:Automata even more. The five main endings aside,
                there is an additional 19 "joke" endings available as well, representing every letter of the alphabet.
                These
                are short and acquired through specific means and are by no means canon to the story.</p>
