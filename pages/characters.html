                <h2>YoRHa No.2 Type B</h2>
                <p>YoRHa No.2 Type B, also known as 2B, serves as the protagonist of Route A in NieR:Automata. She
                    is
                    a
                    YoRHa
                    android created to battle the machine lifeforms that have invaded the planet on behalf of the
                    surviving
                    humans. She served during the 14th Machine War. 2B is a blade of quiet determination. As a
                    combat
                    android, she does not encourage idle chatter on frivolous subjects and is generally reticent
                    towards
                    others. She also has high respect for the chain of command and rarely questions her orders,
                    unlike
                    her
                    partner. However, 2B occasionally expresses a notably sardonic wit in the face of certain
                    situations
                    and
                    can even be hot-headed at times.</p>

                <h2>YoRHa No.9 Type S</h2>
                <p>YoRHa No.9 Type S, also known as 9S, is the protagonist of Branches B and D in NieR:Automata, as
                    well as one of the main antagonists and final boss of Branch C.
                    9S is a Scanner type android who served during the 14th Machine War. He has an attack function,
                    but it is an android that specializes in investigative purposes—a member of the automated
                    infantry squad, YoRHa, who triumphs in hacking-based information collection.</p>

                    She is a prototype of the YoRHa android line, and combat data from her and her comrades was used
                    to create the superior current lines, including 2B and 9S. She doesn't like to speak and often
                    keeps to herself.</p>

                    soldiers in Nier:Automata. They are mainly loaded with various weapons for long-ranged attacks.
                    These Pods display correspondence from the command center and exchange operational intelligence
                    between units. </p>

                <p>Adam is a major character and the secondary antagonist of Branches A and B in NieR:Automata. He
                    is the older twin brother of Eve. Adam appears to be a calm, mysterious and an intellectual man.
                    He is a man of
                    curiosity who aims for one goal, learning more about humanity. Though he would not hesitate to
                    use cruelty in order to achieve his goals. </p>

                <h2>Eve</h2>
                <p>Eve is a major character and the main antagonist of Branches A and B in NieR:Automata. He is the
                    younger twin brother of Adam. Eve is a simple minded man, as he does not like to think deeply
                    about
                    things. He also appears to
                    be childish in a way, specifically with Adam. Unlike Adam, who is intellectual and calm, Eve
                    couldn't care less about knowledge. Rather, he is interested in anything that's related to
                    physical activity.</p>
